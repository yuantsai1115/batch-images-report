# Batch Images Report for Onsite Inspection
A web-based tool for generating practical completion inspection reports. 

## Background
Generally, a Practical Completion Inspection is needed before a handover. Inspectors and builders walk through and collectively review the building works. To make sure the design data aligned to the site, comparisons between the building information models and the onsite photos are needed. After the inspection, inspectors put together these snapshots and photos side-by-side in the reports for documentation. This tool speed up the documentation process by generating the reports from selected images. It reduces the processing time up to 50%.
